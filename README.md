# origin-energy-assessment

## Overview

I focused exclusively on the frontend due to limited time. My priority was to build clean, maintainable, and reusable componentsâ€”things that could scale well beyond this assessment (e.g., modal handling, form logic, API integration). These shared utilities are placed under the `common` module.

### Code Structure

- Files are organized by domain for clarity and modularity.
- Within each domain, code is grouped by type (components, hooks, services, etc.).

## How to Run the Project

1. **Start the frontend**  
   From the `frontend` directory, run:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Mock the backend API**  
   Install JSON Server (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g json-server
   ```
   Then, from the project root, start the mock server:
   ```bash
   json-server --watch mock-data.json --port 4000
   ```
